                            <p>We are the Hall Family—Jake, Kristi, our two energetic children and our lively black Lab. Life in our home is always bustling, and our family keeps us moving at full speed.</p>
                            <p>Faith and Family are the driving force behind the creation of Redemption Renovations. Taking a leap of faith to start this business was inspired by our desire to instill the values of hard work in our children; emphasizing integrity, honesty and passion in everything we do.</p>
                            <p>My journey in construction began in 2007 and includes a variety of experiences that have molded me into who I am today; from the integration of medical equipment in hospitals across the United States, to custom residential new builds, including both HVAC and plumbing service work. Fast forward to 2018-- when I was able to fulfil my dream of becoming a fully licensed builder through the state of Michigan. Additionally, I am proud to have joined our local fire department in 2019 as a paid-on-call firefighter and EMT where I am honored to continue serving my community yet today.</p>
                            <p>Over the years, I have cherished the relationships and connections formed within the trades. As we continue to build Redemption Renovations, I look forward to fostering these bonds and creating new ones through our company for many years to come.</p>
